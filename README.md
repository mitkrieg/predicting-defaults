# Predicting Credit Card Defaults in Taiwan

**Author: Mitchell Krieger**

## Overview

To optimize returns, Banks must manage their risk when providing credit cards to customers. This project attempts to create a model that predicts if a client will or will not default on their loan. The best model was a random forrest and had an accuracy of XXX and F-1 score of XXX. The model was chosen using F-1 score to balance precision and recall (trying not to favor false positives or false negatives).


## Data:

This datset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

## Methods:

Using various binary classification methods
